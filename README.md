# Stock Experiments

These are a collection of experiments or what-if scenarios that I am running with my father-in-law to settle debates or learn from the decisions we made or the stocks that got away.

Experiments:
1. [How to generate cash - 1 or more tranches?](/notebooks/20210625 - How to generate cash - 1 or more tranche?.ipynb) We are looking to rebalance our portfolio and need to generate cash. Now the question is to do it 1 or more tranches? Using the index data from 2019-2020 to model what's the best way to take out cash.
